How to build PlatformIO based project
=====================================

1. `Install PlatformIO Core <http://docs.platformio.org/page/core.html>`_
2. Download `development platform with examples <https://github.com/platformio/platform-lattice_ice40/archive/develop.zip>`_
3. Extract ZIP archive
4. Run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change directory to example
    > cd platform-lattice_ice40/examples/counter

    # Build project
    > platformio run

    # Verify project
    > platformio run --target verify

    # Launch simulation
    > platformio run --target sim

    # Launch time analysis
    > platformio run --target time

    # Upload bitstream into the FPGA
    > platformio run --target upload

    # Clean build files
    > platformio run --target clean

NOTE: `GTKwave <http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net>`_ is required for simulation
